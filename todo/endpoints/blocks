Notefish authentication is done with username and password. The password is
hashed on both the server-side and the client-side to aid the security of users
who reuse their passwords. The salt is a function of your user id.

On authentication success, the client is granted an authentication token. This
token will expire after X hours, or never if requested. Active tokens are
visible in the client via the /api/auth/tokens endpoint, and can be deleted by
any active token.
